Performance Rotors (PR) develops drones and robotics solutions for data-acquisition in GPS-denied and confined space environments without risk to human lives.

*Permission was received from my internship manager to display these projects in my technical portfolio.

I worked on designing and developing mechanical solutions to many complex problems, and I had a great time! Here are some of the highlights:

<br>

• Mechanical design of housing and mounting for new electrical components on a test drone. I also designed the antenna receiver mounts to minimize intrusiveness. The final result was a compact and aesthetic housing which permitted abundant airflow for the fan and heatsink.

• Innovation and development of 3D Printed ultrasonic generator housing and ultrasonic testing probe spring suspension system for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Operations.
