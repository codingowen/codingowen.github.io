I"‚<p>In this project, weâ€™re going to build a simple Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based recurrent model from scratch, using NumPy.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll add a fun twist to this project by training the RNN on a dataset containing song lyrics by Justin Bieber, and weâ€™ll see how well it can generate new lyrics based on the learned patterns!</p>

<p>Given the foundational knowledge on neural networks established in previous projects, weâ€™ll move relatively quickly into the theory for RNNs.</p>

<p>This project is also closely linked to the next one on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, where we will improve on the RNN architecture.</p>
