<b><u>This blog is a Work-in-progress due to the ongoing nature of the internship.</u></b>

Govtech Singapore is a government agency which functions as the tech arm of Singapore's government. It builds tech-based products to make live better for citizens, businesses, international audiences and the public service sector.

During my internship, I was attached to the Data Engineering Practice, making data-focused products to help other government agencies.

More specific details about the project can be published once my work is open-sourced for educating other government agencies (~ May 2025). 

Some expected technical learnings from the project include:
- Large-scale ML experiment design
- Literature review of sequential (mostly time-series) synthetic data generation techniques
- In-depth study and exploration of relevant ML models (Probabilistic Autoregressive, GANs, Fourier analysis-based models, Diffusion models, Transformer hybrid models, etc.)
- White paper research / publication / writing

The white paper is expected to be open-sourced at the end of the project as well.
