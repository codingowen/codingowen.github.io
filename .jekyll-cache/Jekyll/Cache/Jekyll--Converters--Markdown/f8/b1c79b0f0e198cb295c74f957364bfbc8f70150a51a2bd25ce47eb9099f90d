I"U<p>This was an engineering design competition, where we were tasked to design a solution that solved any problem.</p>

<p>The idea came about when I saw the huge amount of plastic waste from takeout that would be dumped into the garbage bins outside my workplace. We decided to make reusable lunchboxes more convenient for people to use, to encourage consumers to choose the slightly more inconvenient, but much more environmentally friendly option.</p>

<p>My team innovated and designed a folding lunchbox concept, and I lead my team of 5 engineers through the full design and prototyping process, including CAD design, 3D Printing, mechanical fastening and assembly. I also directed market research on existing products and user needs to identify &amp; improve business viability.</p>

<p>There is also a really cringe submission video on YouTube (with really loud audio, beware earphone users), but I guess itâ€™s a fun memory. In hindsight, we really should have chosen non-translucent silicone :P</p>
