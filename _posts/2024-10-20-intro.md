Hi! Welcome to my technical blog. 

As of October 2024, I'm in my first year of Master's studies in Data Science & Machine Learning. 

I decided to start writing to make sure that I understand the things I'm learning well enough to formalize them in writing and explain them simply. 

As such, I expect that most of my writing will concern relatively basic topics for a while. I may also write about a few other topics of interest from different technical domains sometimes. 

I would also like to give full credit to Gregory Gundersen for sharing about <a href="https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/06/21/blog-theme/" target="_blank">how he built his excellent blog</a>. I love simple styles with substantial content, and I will strive towards that.

I'm excited to learn lots of cool things and share them here. At the same time, I'm sure there will be some silly mistakes made along the way - please contact me if there are any errata in my posts.

Thank you for reading, and let's get going!
