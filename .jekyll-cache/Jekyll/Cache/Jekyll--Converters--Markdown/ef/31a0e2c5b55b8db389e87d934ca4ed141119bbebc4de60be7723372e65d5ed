I"t<p>Performance Rotors (PR) develops drones and robotics solutions for data-acquisition in GPS-denied and confined space environments without risk to human lives.</p>

<p>*Permission was received from my internship manager to display these projects in my technical portfolio.</p>

<p>I worked on designing and developing mechanical solutions to many complex problems, and I had a great time! Here are some of the highlights:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>• Mechanical design of housing and mounting for new electrical components on a test drone. I also designed the antenna receiver mounts to minimize intrusiveness. The final result was a compact and aesthetic housing which permitted abundant airflow for the fan and heatsink.</p>
