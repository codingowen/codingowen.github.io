I"#<p>Hi! Welcome to my technical blog.</p>

<p>As of October 2024, I’m in my first year of Master’s studies in Data Science &amp; Machine Learning.</p>

<p>I decided to start writing to make sure that I understand the things I’m learning well enough to formalize them in writing and explain them simply.</p>

<p>As such, I expect that most of my writing will concern relatively basic topics for a while. I may also write about a few other topics of interest from different technical domains sometimes.</p>

<p>I would also like to give full credit to Gregory Gundersen for sharing about <a href="https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/06/21/blog-theme/" target="_blank">how he built his excellent blog</a>. I love simple styles with substantial content, and I will strive towards that.</p>

<p>I’m excited to learn lots of cool things and share them here. At the same time, I’m sure there will be some silly mistakes made along the way - please contact me if there are any errata in my posts.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, and let’s get going!</p>
