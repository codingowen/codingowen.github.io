I spent quite a few months learning how to build an 8-bit breadboard computer from Ben Eater's youtube series. I ordered the hardware and brought it back to Singapore with me after my internship in California.

The build process was surprisingly long, with many hardware bugs along the way. I had to make multiple modifications along the way - decoupling capacitors, a debouncing mechanism for the system timer, clock-line noise isonation, and many more, to make the computer more stable.

As a result, the 8-bit computer is able to run some simple arithmetic logic and instruction sequences. I made a Youtube video demonstrating the computer running through the fibonacci sequence.
