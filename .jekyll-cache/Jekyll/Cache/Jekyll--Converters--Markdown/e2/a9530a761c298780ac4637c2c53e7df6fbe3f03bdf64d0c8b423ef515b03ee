I"<p>Mill Industries is a startup that produces consumer electronics products that tackle food waste related climate emissions.</p>

<p>The company provides an all-inclusive food recycling service that works by cutting down and drying any household food waste into food grounds, and sending them to farms for use as chicken feed! I worked on the following key projects:</p>

<p>•  Designed and engineered a full-stack hardware data collection, analysis and visualization pipeline utilizing Torque Sensors, Labjack DAQ, InfluxDB and Grafana. This system was a critical component for quantitative experimentation and validating
cost-saving designs that lowered manufacturing costs by up to 40% on the motor system.</p>

<p>• Led the design and testing process for the core grinding and drying function of our next generation product offering</p>

<p>• Innovated low-cost test fixtures using pneumatic actuation methods for reliable quality control in production factory</p>

<p>• Achieved significantly lower manufacturing and assembly costs of using DFA &amp; DFM methods</p>

<p>Here are some diagrams demonstrating the mechanical components in the product.</p>
