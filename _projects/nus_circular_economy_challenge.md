As part of this competition with a circular economy theme, our team engineered a solution to turn used face masks into vacuum cleaner filters.


We first developed the design, mechanical fastening, and manufacturing process of our product. (Yes, it works!) I also took on business development, and planned out the revenue model, business partnerships and social media campaigns.

I also successfully pitched our business case to a panel of industry experts, competition judges and a live audience, and we managed to clinch the first place for this competition! We were featured on Channel News Asia (CNA) as well.
